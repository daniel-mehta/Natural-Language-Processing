The following generation flags are not valid and may be ignored: ['temperature', 'top_p', 'top_k']. Set `TRANSFORMERS_VERBOSITY=info` for more details.
Explain quantum entanglement in simple terms. Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon that occurs when two or more particles become connected in such a way that the state of one particle is directly related to the state of the other, no matter how far apart they are. This means that if you measure a property (such as spin or polarization) of one particle, you instantly know the corresponding property of the other particle, even if it's light-years away.

To understand this better, imagine two entangled particles as two dancers who have practiced together so

<s> Explain quantum entanglement in simple terms.

Quantum entanglement is a special connection between two or more particles, where the state of one particle is directly connected to the state of another particle, no matter how far apart they are. This means that if you measure the state of one particle, you instantly know the state of the other particle, even if it's on the other side of the universe. This phenomenon is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics and has been experimentally proven. It's important to note that this
